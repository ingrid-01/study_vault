**2 Box types in CSS**
1. Block
2. Inline

# Block vs. Inline #
- Default style = `block`

`margin-left: auto;` → pushes all content to left (like left column)
`margin-right: auto;` → pushes all content to right (right column)
If `margin-left: auto;` and `margin-right: auto;` used together = centers content
OR `margin: 0 auto;` = so both left and right are `auto`
### Block-Lvl Elements ###
 - always starts on a NEW LINE
 - Browsers auto-add some space (margin) before & after element

- ALWAYS take up FULL WIDTH available 

- Most common block elements: `<p>` and `<div>`
	- `<p>` = defines paragraph in an HTML doc
	- `<div>` = defines division / section in an HTML doc

- Inline element ≠ new line; appear w whatever element they're next to
	- e.g. `<a>` tag, link = part of the paragraph
	- padding & margin ≠ inline element
		- DON'T put extra padding or margin on inline element
### Inline Elements ###
- DOESN'T start on a new line
- only takes up as much width as necessary
- `<span>`

==inline element CAN'T contain a block-lvl element==
### Middle Ground inline-block ###
Inline-block = inline element BUT w block-style padding & margin
	`display: inline-block` → probs better to use FLEXBOX

**display: inline-block** = side-by-side box
	→ allows set a width & height on the element
	- `display: inline` = top & bottom margins & paddings AREN'T respected

	- `display: block` = a line break happens after element

## Divs and Spans ##
- `<divs>` and `<spans>` ≠ semantic; just generic boxes, can contain ANYTHING
- ID / Class  is given to divs and spans
- It's USEFUL as a "hook"; grouping related elements under 1 parent

**Div**
- block-lvl element by DEFAULT
- common HTML container element 
- *divides* page into diff. blocks + apply styling 
- has NO REQUIRED ATTS. → ==but== `style, class, id` are common
- When used w CSS, `<div>` can be used to style BLOCKS of content

**Span**
- inline-lvl element by DEFAULT
- group text content + inline HTML container
- Should only be used when no semantic HTML element is appropriate
	- ==USED AS LAST ELEMENT==
- has NO REQUIRED ATTS. → but `style, class, id` are common
- When used w CSS, `<span>` can be used to style PARTS of text

## Additional Resource: "Normal Flow" ##
- no CSS applied = **normal flow** 
	- change how elements behave by: 1. adjusting their position OR removing them from it altogether
- Best way to begin webpage = solid, well-structured document that's READABLE
	- allowing users to access readable content with VERY LIMITED BROWSER/DEVICE (e.g. screenreader)
### Default Element Layout ###
- First, boxes of ind. elements = BOX MODEL
- Block-lvl element default = fills available inline space of parent element
	- grows block dimension for its content
- inline-lvl element = size of their content
	- set `width and height` on default `display` property value 
		- e.g. `<img>`
		- BUT `display` value remain `inline`

CONTROLLING `display` property of inline-lvl element = CSS to block-lvl element
	e.g. `display: block;` or `display: inline-block;`

### Overriding Normal Flow ###
- `display` property → standard values (e.g. `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`) change how element behave in normal flow
	- e.g. block-lvl element behaving like an inline-lvl element 

- Floats
	- applying `float` value (e.g. `left`) can cause block-lvl element to WRAP along one side of an element
	- e.g. imgs have text floating around them in magazines

- Positioning
	- `position` property → precise control of box placement INSIDE other boxes
	- `static` positioning → default in normal flow
	- changes can be made → e. g. `position: fixed`

-  Specific layout systems accessed through `display`
	- most important entire layout methods: CSS grid and Flexbox
		- both alters child element layout inside their parents

- Responsive Design
	- creates layouts that adapt to diff. devices the WP is rendered on (desktops & mobile phones)
	- doesn't provide specific layout tools 
		- most significant component = `@media` (allows apply diff. layout depending on device attributes such as screen width or resolution)
### Other Layout Techniques ###
Less commonly used techs:

- Table Layout
	- styling parts of HTML table used on non-table elements - `display: table` + associated properties
- Multi-column Layout
	- cause content of a block to lay out in columns 
		- like in newspaper
