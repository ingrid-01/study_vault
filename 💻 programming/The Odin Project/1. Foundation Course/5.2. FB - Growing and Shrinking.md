## Flex Shorthand ##
- `flex` declaration = shorthand for 3 properties
	- `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`
```css
div {
	flex: 1;
}
```
↳ `flex: 1` = `flex-grow: 1;`, `flex-shrink: 1;`, and `flex-basis: 0;`
- usually flex has one value, but that value covers `flex-grow` 
- so `flex: 1` = `flex: 1 1 0`

### Flex-grow ###
`flex-grow` = expects a single number value = 'growth factor'

`flex: 1;` to every div inside containers, we are telling every div to grow the same amount
`flex: 2;` to 1 div, then div would grow 2x to others
### Flex-shrink ##
`flex-shrink` = applied if size of ALL flex items are larger than their parent container
	e.g. if 3 divs (flex-items) had `width: 100px;` and `.flex-container = <300px;` = our divs need to shrink to fit

Default: `flex-shrink: 1;` = all items will shrink EVENLY
- If I don't want shrinkage, `flex-shrink: 0;` (this will prevent item to get smaller even with smaller browser window)
- the value can be changed as I want

When SPECIFYING `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` = `width` given isn't respected
- If 3 divs are given same width (e.g. 250px), but parent is >750px = they'll grow to fit
- If 3 divs are given same width, but parent is <750px, they'll shrink to fit
### Flex-basis ###
`flex-basis` = sets the initial size of flex item
- so before `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` kicks in, this is the baseline

- DEFAULT: 
1. `flex-basis: 0%;` when `flex: 1;` is specified
2. `flex-basis: auto;` when nothing is specified
	∴ so if I want to ONLY adjust an item's `flex-grow` = do it directly, not shorthand ver. OR state each value `flex: 1 1 auto;` which is same as `flex: auto;`

-  if `flex-basis: auto;` = item's content size or `width/height` (if set), as its **base size**
- `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` are applied relative to this auto-calculated size
	- to use when content size matters = content-sensitive

`flex-basis: 0%` (or `0`)
- ignores content size
- treats base size as 0 = `flex-grow` value will use the free space
- commonly used for **equal width distribution**
- to use when equal distribution is desired = layout-balanced
