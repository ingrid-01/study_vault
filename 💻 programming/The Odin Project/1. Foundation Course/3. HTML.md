- Always name HTMl files by `index.html` 
	- web servers look for `index.html` by DEFAULT
	- not having one causes problem

- macOS: Navigate to the directory containing the file and type `open ./index.html`

- `<a href="https://example.com" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Example</a>`
	- ==For privacy and security reasons==, always pair `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
	- `noopener`: prevents new opened link to interact with original page
	- `noreferrer`: prevents new page to know where the user came from

**Absolute Links**
`scheme://domain/path`

So in a URL: `https://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html`
`http://` = scheme
`www.example.com` = Domain name
`:80` = port
+ And rest is the file path

**Relative Links**
- no domain name
- only file path
- prepending `./` before a rel link = prevent running into unexpected issues when opening the link
	- `./` = instructing to "start looking for the file/directory relative to the CURRENT directory"

- to navigate up a directory = `../`
	- to navigate up through MULTIPLE directories = `../../elsewhere.html`

**Root-Relative Links**
- similar to relative links BUT it's when relative to the "root" of the ENTIRE website
- BUT only possible on a WS hosted on a web server, not local file

If we had a server, the link would look like this:
`Root-relative links <a href="/">home page</a>`
	↳ `/` forward slash represents the root of the site

## Images ##
### JPG Images ###
- +ves:
	- handles lrg color palettes w/o big increasing file size
	- Good for photos + imgs with ↑ gradients
- -ves:
	- don't allow transparent pixels - white edges can be seen
### GIFs ###
- +ves:
	- simple animations
- -ves:
	- limited in color palette - don't use for photos
	- binary transparent pixels = can't have semi-opaque pixels
### PNG Images ###
- +ves:
	- Good for anything BUT photo or animated
		- PNG photo files are bigger
	- handles opacity well
	- no color palette limitations
	- Good for icons, technical diagrams, logos etc.
### SVG Images ###
- +ves:
	- vector-based graphics = can scale ↑ and ↓ no prob
	- great for responsive design
- -ves:
	- need to convert any text fields to outlines using image editor (e.g. Abode Illustrator or Sketch). 
		- lots of text = big file size

- Only set ONE size attribute if wanting to scale proportionally
	- doing both = stretch the img
	- e.g. `<img src="file.jpg" width="75"/>`

## HTML Entities ##
- less than = `&lt;`
- greater than = `&gt;`
- ampersand = `&amp;`

## Quotes ##
- Curly quotation marks - opening and closing (left/right) single and double quotes
`&ldquo;`
`&rdquo;`
`&lsquo;`
`&rsquo;`

# Commit Messages #
- important to use a good commit msg!!
	- easier for collaborators to understand what's happening
	- employers look for devs who utilises commit msgs well

## Effective Commit ##
Needs a subject + a body

1. Subject
	- brief summary of the change I made
	- e.g. `This is the change I made to the codebase`
	- ==GitHub has 72-char limit!==
2. Body
	- concise yet clear description of what I did
	- e.g. `Describe the problem your commit solves and how`

A good Commit incls:
- specific subject. e.g. `Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo`
- concise + descriptive body - why commit needed to be made - e.g. `Screen readers won't read the images to user with disabilities without this information`
- subject & body separated w a new/blank line.
	- e.g. 
```
subject

Body
```

- when building project, remember to:
```
git add .
git commit -OR- git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
```
and message should be structured with 
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
