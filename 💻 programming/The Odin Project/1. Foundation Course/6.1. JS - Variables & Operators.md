# Running JavaScript Code #
1. Create an HTML file w a JS code
	- HTML boilerplate + `<script>` tag
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
</head>
<body> 

	<script>
		// Your JS goes here!
		console.log("Hello, World!")
	</script>

</body>
</html>
```

OR

2. Incl. JS through an external script - like external CSS
```html
<script src="javascript.js"></script>
```

JavaScript file extension = `.js`
↳ external JS files are used for more complex scripts

# Variables #
variables = storage containers

- Create (declares) a variable = `let` keyword
```js
let name = "John";
let surname = "Doe";

console.log(name);
console.log(surname);
```

- re-assign variables:
```js
let age = 11;
console.log(age); // outputs 11 to the console

age = 54;

console.log(age); //what will be output now?
```
↳ When `let` has been declared earlier, doesn't need to be declared again
- `const` keyword

- NOT re-assigning variables:
```JS
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 10;

console.log(pi); // What will be output?
```
↳ error occurs!!
- Having errors in our code = tells us what's wrong w the code
	- VERY IMPORTANT

∴ 
- `let` re-assigns
- `const` can't re-assign + thrown an error if we try

- 3rd way = `var` 
	- OG way declared in JS
	- similar to `let` but not used anymore
		- BUT may come across later, so need to know
# Numbers #
- BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROGRAMMING LOGIC
	- need to know maths
	- if `(3 + 2) - 76 * (1 + 1)` is placed in `console.log`
		- it'll evaluate the expression + output the correct number

## Additional Resources 1: Variables ##

JavaScript application needs to work w information. 
2 most common examples:
1. An online shop - info. may incl. goods being sold & a shopping cart
2. A chat application - info. may incl. users, msgs etc. 

==Variables = store this info!==
↳ "named storage"

↓ this statement creates/declares a variable called '*message*'
```js
let message;
```

"Equals" symbol = puts data into the variable
```js
let message;

message = 'Hello'; //store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
```

- string is saved = it can be accessed by `alert`
```js
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

alert(message); // shows the variable content
```

- to shorten: 
```js
let message = 'Hello!' // define the variable & assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

- multiple variables declaration in one line
	- BUT not recommended; bad readability
```js
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello!';
```
- so try ↓ one of these 3:
```js
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message 'Hello!'

let user = 'John',
	age = 25,
	message = 'Hello!';

let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = 'Hello!';
```

### Real-Life Analogy ###
 - variable = box
 - string = value, data in the box

- ANY value can be in the box and it can always be changed
```js
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!' // value changed

alert(message);
```
↳ old data is removed and replaced by the new value

- 2 variables declaration & copy data from one into the other
```js
let hello = 'Hello world!';
let message;

// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

//now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); //Hello world!
```

‼️Declaring twice = error
- variables should be declared ONCE
	- repeated declaration of the same variable is an error
```js
let message = "This";

// repeated 'let' leads to an error
let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
```

### Variable Naming ###

- 2 limitations on variable names in JS:
	1. name must contain: letters, digits, symbols $ and _
	2. first character ≠ a digit
```js
let userName;
let test123;
```

- use camelCase when using multiple words - `myVeryLongName`
- other valid names:
```js
let $ = 1; // declared a varaible with the name "$"
let _ = 2; // and now a varaible with the name "_"

alert($ + _); // 3
```

- invalid names:
```js
let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // hyphems '-' aren't allowed in the name
```

‼️ Case Matters = variables `apple` and `APPLE` are 2 different names

‼️ Non-Latin letters are allowed BUT not recommended
- no errors in using the symbols and characters (e.g. Cyrillic letters, Chinese logograms)
- BUT other programmers need to read the code too; English is more universal

‼️ Reserved Names = can't be used as variable names 
e.g. `let`, `class`, `return`,`function`
```js
let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
```

‼️ W/O `let`, variables still can be declared BUT bad practice
```js
// note: no "use strict" in this example

num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist

alert(num); // 5

// BUT 
"use strict";
num = 5; // error: num is not defined
```

### Constants ###
- declare constant (unchanging) variable:
```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
```

- can't be reassigned
```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```

==ONLY to be used when I'm sure that a variable will never change==

### Uppercase constants ###
- when values are difficult to remember = uppercase constants are used (Capital letters + underscores)
```js
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

//...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); //#FF7F00
```

BENEFITS:
- `COLOR_ORANGE` = easier to remember than `#FF7F00`
	↳ also, more meaningful (easily understandable)

- capital-named constants = ONLY used for "hard-coded" values
### Name things right ###
- spend time to think about right names for variables before declaring
- Good-to-follow rules:
	1. Use human-readable names like `userName` or `shoppingCart`
	2. Stay away from abbreviations or short names like `a`, `b` and `c`, unless you know what you're doing
	3. Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are `data` and `value`. Such names say nothing. it's only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing
	4. Agree on terms within your team and in your mind. If a site visitor is called a "user" then we should name related variables `currentUser` or `newUser` instead of `currentlyVisitor` or `newManInTown`

⚠️ Better to create an extra variable than to reuse
## Additional Resources 2: JavaScript Arithmetic ##

### JS Arithmetic Operators ###

| OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                                                            |
| -        | Subtraction                                                         |
| *        | Multiplication                                                      |
| **       | Exponentiation - raises the 1st operand to the power of 2nd operand |
| /        | Division                                                            |
| %        | Modulus (Remainder) - returns division remainder                    |
| ++       | Increment (by +1)                                                   |
| --       | Decrement (by -1)                                                   |
### Arithmetic Operations ###
- typical operation = operated on two numbers

Literals:
`let x = 100 + 50;`

Variables:
`let x = a + b;`

Expressions:
`let x = (100 + 50) * a;`
### Operators & Operands ###
- numbers in arithmetic operations = **operands**
- operation (to be performed btw the 2 operands) is defined by an **operator**

| Operand | Operator | Operand |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| 100     | +        | 50      |
```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
```
↳ same structure for +, -, multiple, /, %
```js
let x = 5;
x++;
let z = x;
```
↳ same structure for decrementing
```js
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;
```
```js
let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x,2);
```
↳ both results the same!!
### Operator Precedence ###
- the order which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression
```js
let x = 100 + 50 * 3;
```
↳ so as usual, multiplication would be done first
```js
let x = (100 + 50) * 3;
```
↳ parentheses would be first
## Additional Resources 3: JavaScript Numbers ##
- JS uses numbers w and w/o decimals
- LARGE and SMALL numbers can be used w scientific (exponent) notation
```js
let x = 3.14;
let y = 123e5; // 12300000
let z = 123e-5; // 0.00123
```
### JS Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point ###
- Unlike other programming languages, JS doesn't define diff. types of numbers 
	- e.g. integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
- JS numbers are ALWAYS stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard

- This format stores numbers in 64 bits (number is stored in bits 0 to 51, exponent in bits 52 and 62, and the sign in bit 63):

| Value (aka Fraction / Mantissa)                                                          | Exponent                                                              | Sign                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 52 bits (0 - 51)                                                                         | 11 bits (52 - 62)                                                     | 1 bit (63)          |
| stores the significant digits of the number in binary                                    | encodes the magnitude (how big or small the number is)                | 0 - positive number |
| Always has an implicit leading 1 for normalised numbers (so really 53 bits of precision) | stored w a "bias" of 1023 (so exponent 0 is stored as 1023 in binary) | 1 - negative number |
- floating-point: represents very large, very small or fractional numbers in binary by **moving** ("floating")the decimal point to where it's needed
### Integer Precision ###
- integers (numbers w/o a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits
```js
let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999  
let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000
```
==maximum number of decimals is 17==
### Floating Precision ###
```js
let x = 0.2 + 0.1;
```
↳ this won't calculate properly, so use this ↓ 
```js
let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;
```
### Adding Numbers and Strings ###
```js
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;
```
↳ only this will result in `30`

```js
let x = "10"
let y = 20
let z = x + y;
```
↳ anything like this or other than the OG example, it'll result i a string concatenation = `1020`
### Numeric Strings ###
JS strings can have numeric content:
```js
let x = 100; // x is a number
let y = "100"; // y is a string
```
BUT divide, multiply, minus will work with:
```js
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x - y;
```
just addition won't work, JS will concatenate the strings instead.
### NaN - Not a Number ###
- NaN = JS word indicating that a number is not a legal number
- trying to do arithmetic w a non-numeric string will result in NaN:
```js
let x = 100 / "Apple";
```

Global JS function `isNaN()` to find out if a value is a not a number:
```js
let x = 100 / "Apple";
is Nan(x);
```
↳ this will result in: `true`

```js
let x = NaN;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y;
```
↳ this will result in a concatenation = `NaN5`

`NaN` is a number: `typeof NaN` returns `number`
### Infinity ###
`Infinity` or `-Infinity` = when calculating number outside the largest possible number
```js
let myNumber = 2;
// Execute until Infinity
while (myNumber != Infinity) {
	myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
}
```

Division by 0 (zero) also generates `Infinity` and `-Infinity`: 
```js
let x = 2 / 0;
let y = -2 / 0;
```

`Infinity` = number: `typeof Inifity` = `number`

### Hexadecimal ###
JS interprets numeric constants as hexadecimal IF they are preceded by 0x:
```js
let x = 0xFF;
```
↳ 0xFF = 255

‼️ Never write a number w a leading 0 (e.g. 07, 010)
↳ this can be interpreted as octal

DEFAULT - JS displays numbers as **base 10** decimals

`toString()` = makes output from **base 2** to **base 36**

Hexadecimal = **base 16**
Decimal = **base 10**
Octal = **base 8**
Binary = **base 2**

### JS Numbers as Objects ###
- Default for JS numbers = primitive values created from literals
	- `let x = 123;` means the number `123`

When numbers are defined as OBJECTS w `new`:
```js
let y = new Number(123);
```
↳ results = `object`
BUT ‼️ DO NOT CREATE number objects‼️
`new` complicated code + slows down execution speed
- also produce unexpected results

#### == and === basics ####
- == → loose quality
	- compares values after type conversion (JS will try to make the types match before comparing)
- === → strict equality
	- compares both value and type exactly, with no automatic converstion

#### How == works ####
== unwraps Number object into its primitive value before comparing
```js
42 == new Number(42); // true
```

WHY?
- Left: `42` (primitive number)
- Right: `new Number(42)` → converts to primitive 42 via `.valueOf()` (automated JS rule when using == ) 

#### How === works ####
=== does NOT unwrap; checks type first
```js
42 === new Number(42); // false
```

WHY?
- Left: primitive number (`"number"`)
- Right: Number object (`"object"`)
- Different types → immediately false (skips `.valueOf()` step)

ALSO → comparing 2 JS objects ALWAYS returns **False**

## Additional Resource 3: Basic math in JS - numbers and operators ##

**Integers** - numbers w/o fractional part - either +Ve or -ve

**Floating point numbers** (floats) - numbers w decimal points 

### Assignment Operators ###
- Operators that assign a value to a variable. 
E.g. = → assignment operator
```js
let x = 3; // x contains value of 3
let y = 4; // y contains value of 4
x = y; // x now ocntains the same value y contains, 4
```
↳ = sign assigns a value to x and y variables

| Operator | Name                      | Purpose                                         | Example | Shortcut for |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| +=       | Addition assignment       | Adds value on right, returns new variable value | x += 4; | x = x + 4;   |
| -+       | Subtraction assignment    | Subtracts value on right                        | x -= 3; | x = x - 3;   |
| *=       | Multiplication assignment | Multiplies value on right                       | x *= 3; | x = x * 3;   |
| /=       | Division assignment       | Divides value on the right                      | x /= 5; | x = x / 5;   |
```js
let x = 3; // x contains value of 3
let y = 4; // y contains value of 4
x *= y; // x now contains value of 12
```
### Sizing a Canvas ###
- changing the size of a box via defining width & height (px)
	- initial value = 50
```js
const canvas = document.getElementById ("canvas");
const para = document.querySelector ("p");
const ctx = canvas.getContext ("2d");

let x = 50;
let y = 50;

ctx.clearRect (0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
ctx.fillStyle = "green";
ctx.fillRect (10, 10, x, y);
para.textContent = `The rectaangle is ${x}px wide and ${y}px high.`;
```
![[canvasbox_sizing_20250816_1439.jpeg]]

### Comparison Operators ###
- running true/false tests 

| Operator | Name                     | Purpose                                                                      | Example     |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ===      | Strict equality          | Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another         | 5 === 2 + 4 |
| !==      | Strict-non-eqaulity      | Tests whether the left and right values are **not** identical to one another | 5 !== 2 + 3 |
| <        | Less than                | Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one                   | 10 < 6      |
| >        | Greater than             | Tests ... left value greater than the right                                  | 10 > 20     |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | Tests...left value smaller/equal to than right                               | 3 <=2       |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | Test...left value greater than/equal to right                                | 5 >= 4      |
* == and != are also being used BUT not recommended; prone to errors as they aren't STRICT

```html
<button>Start machine</button>
<p>The machine is stopped.</p>
```
```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const txt = document.querySelector("p");

btn.addEventListener("click", updateBtn);

function updateBtn() {
	if (btn.textContent === "Start machine") {
		btn.textContent = "Stop machine";
		txt.textContent = "The machine has started!";
	} else {
		btn.textContent = "Start machine";
		txt.textContent = "The machine is stopped.";
	}
}
```
## Additional Resources 4: Basic Operators, maths ##
### Terms: "unary", "binary", "operand"
"unary" = single operand
	unary negation = - reverses the sign of a number
```js
let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert(x); // -1, unary negation was applied
```

"binary" = two operands
```js
let x = 1, y = 3;
alert(y - x); // 2, binary minus subtracts values
```

**Remainder %**
```js
alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainer of 5 divided by 2
alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4
```

**Exponentiation**
```js
alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 2^2 = 4
alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 2^3 = 8
alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 2^4 = 16
```
↳ can also use non-integers like 1/2

### String concatenation w Binary + ###
```js
let s = "my" + "string";
alert(s); //mystring

alert( '1' + 2 ); // "12"
alert( 2 + '1' ); // "21"
alert( 2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" not 221
alert( '1' + 2 + 2 ); // "122" and not "14"

alert( 6 - '2' ); //4, converts '2' to number 
alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
```
↳ Only `+` supports these string; other arithmetics always convert operands to numbers
### Numeric conversion, Unary + ###
- unary `+` (single value and the plus sign) = doesn't do anything to the number
- BUT if operand is NOT a number, unary `+` converts it into a number
```js
// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert( +x ); // 1

let y = -2;
alert( +y ); // -2

// Converts non-numbers
alert( +tru ); // 1
alert( +"" ); // 0
```
↳ same as `Number(...)` BUT shorter

- Converting strings to numbers
```js
let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";
alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings

let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert( +apples + +oranges ); //5

// the longer variant
// alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5
```
↳ unary plus converts strings to numbers → binary plus sums them up
### Operator Precedence ###
- unary operators are higher precedence than binary ones
### Assignment ###
= → low priority of precedence
```js
let x = 2 * 2 + 1;

alert( x ); // 5
```
#### Assignment = returns a value ####
```js
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);

alert( a ); // 3
alert( c ); // 0
```
↳ this works, BUT don't write code like this
#### Chaining Assignments ####
```js
let a, b, c;

a = b = c = 2 + 2;

alert( a ); // 4
alert( b ); // 4
alert( c ); // 4
```
↳ evaluates from RIGHT to LEFT = so ↑ c, b then a
```js
c = 2 + 2;
b = c;
a = c;
```
↳ split it like this for readability
### Modify-in-place ###
```js
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;

// or shortened:
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)
alert( n ); // 14

// other example:
let n = 2;
n *= 3 + 5; // right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8
alert( n ); // 16
```
### Increment/Decrement ###
```js
let counter = 2;
counter++;        // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 3

let counter = 2;
counter--;        // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 1
```

- POSTFIX form: `counter++`
	- returns old value (prior to increment/decrement)
	- When OLD NUMBER is needed first, but still wants to go up by 1
- PREFIX form: `++counter`
	- returns new value
	- When NEW NUMBER is needed IMMEDIATELY

```js
let value = 5;
console.log(++value); // 6 (because it added first, then showed you)

let value = 5;
console.log(value++); // 5 (shows you first)
console.log(value); // 6 (now it added the extra value)
```

==`++/--` has higher precedence than most arithmetical operations==
```js
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4

let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2, because counter++ returns the "old" value
```
To make ↑ more readable so "One Line, One Action"
```js
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter );
counter++;
```

### Bitwise operators ###
- not JS specific, supported in most programming lagnuages

AND (`&`)
OR (`|`)
XOR (`^`)
NOT (`~`)
LEFT SHIFT (`<<`)
RIGHT SHIFT (`>>`)
ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT (`>>>`)

### Comma ###
- most rare operators
	- used for writing shorter codes
	- allows multiple expressions and comma divides them
		- each evaluated BUT only the result of last one is returned
```js
let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);

alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
```
==comma precedence = lower than equal sign SO parentheses IMPORTANT==
if `a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4`
`a = 3, 7`
`a = 3` as `(a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4`
∴ 3 + 4 or 7 is ignored

WHEN TO USE a COMMA
```js
// three operations in one line
for ( a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) {
...
}
```
↳ these do come up in JS, but usually don't improve code readability

‼️ ONLY common safe use for a comma as an operator = `for` loop update clause
e.g.
```js
for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
	console.log(i, j);
}
```

Exercise
```js
let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);

alert(a + b); // 12

let a = +prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = +prompt("Second number?", 2;
alert(a + b); // 3

or 

alert(+a + +b); // 3
```
