# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects #

## Module 1 ##
### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes ###
#### Focused Mode ####
- not know the pattern / connections
- Not know what that pattern / connections are and where it is
- BUT can cast a strong light in a single area, but weakly everywhere else
#### Diffuse Mode ####
- can look at things broadly
- can make new neural connections
- BUT not strongly in one area

### Textbook ###
- 'A Mind for Numbers' - Barbara Oakley, Ph. D. 

### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes --Or, a Little Dali will do You ###
- When learning something new, esp. something difficult, need to go back & forth btw 2 learning modes
- work a little bit everyday
### What is Learning ###
- learning changes structure of the brain 
- brain gets an upgrade after we wake up
- www.brainfacts.org
### Procrastination, Memory & Sleep ###
- Pomodoro - invented by Francesco Cirillo in 1980s
	- 25mins + 5 mins rule
- Practice makes permanence
- learning by doing + learning through osmosis (keeping yourself around experts)
- boring lectures? ask questions = keeps you in active learning mode

### Article 1 ###
#### Notes on Note-Taking: Review of Research and Insights for Students & Instructors ####
**Michael C. Friedman, Harvard Initiative for Learning & Teaching (Harvard University)**

Things to Avoid
- Avoid Transcribing notes → write condensed notes in my own words
- Review my notes on the same day as creating them on regular basis

- note-taking= cognitively demanding as playing chess
	- need to think about how to utilise my WM effectively 
	- don't just write what's been told & taught
	- also, REVISE and EDIT my notes constantly
##### How can we assess the Quality of Notes? #####
- doesn't matter only if you can understand it or if others can comprehend your notes. 
- what matter is can I understand the notes effectively and efficiently
	- Quality is imp., not quantity

##### Key Insights #####
1. Longhand >>>> Laptop for memory retention
	1. writing by hand = encourage active processing 
	2. typing = transcription + weaker WM encoding
2. Three-stage process enhances learning
	1. *Recording* - if in lecture, record rather than typing
	2. *Reviewing* - review quickly, within 24hrs!!!
	3. *Reflecting and Revising* - later to consolidate + connect ideas
3. Cues & Structure
4. Notes needs to be used for SELF-QUIZZING - turn them into flashcards and/or outlines 
##### Implementation in Your Study Routine #####
- immediately after each lesson, spend ~10mins **reviewing & annotating** 
	- add keywords and Qs
- A day later → **reinterpret** notes
	- reorganise, connect to previous lessons + test memory by covering content & recalling
- Periodically **rewrite or refine** notes into polished summaries 

### Article 2 ###
#### Strengthening the Student Toolbox ####
Study Strategies to Boost Learning
**By John Dunlosky**

- Some strategies to consider
	1. Distributed Practice → Spread study session over time = better retention
	2. Interleaved Practice → Mi x topics, Subjects, problem types 
	3. Elaborative interrogation → ask "why?"
	4. Self-explanation → explain to self why = teach myself

- Implement:
	- Put in schedule for Regular self-quizzing + summary sheet day
