Orientation of items WIHTIN a flex container
→ controlled w `flex-direction`

> 2 axes of a flex container
> - and how to change those axes to arrange my content in columns instead of rows

# Axes #
- flexboxes work both horizontally or vertically & rules change depending on the direction

- DEFAULT → `row`; horizontal
- changed direction → `column`; vertical 
	- written in CSS like this ↓ 
```css
.flex-containier {
	flex-direction: column;
}
```

2 axes: main axis & cross axies
- direction of these axes changes when `flex-direction` is changed
- *most* circumstances: 
	- `flex-direction: row;` = main axis = horizontal (left-to-right)
	- `flex-direction: column` = main axis = vertical (top-to-bottom)
```css
.flex-container {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
}
```
- BUT `flex-direction: column;` doesn't work w `flex: 1;` property
	- it works with `flex: 1 1 auto;`
		- this tells flex items to have given height as default
	- BECAUSE `flex: 1;` = `flex-basis: 0;`
		- so `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` will calculate from 0
		- empty divs by default have `height: 0;` = flex items don't need height

- when `flex-direction: column;` = `height` is referred instead of `width`
