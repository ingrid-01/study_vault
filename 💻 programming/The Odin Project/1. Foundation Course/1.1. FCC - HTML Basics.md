# Link Element #
- link to external resources → stylesheet & site icons
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
```
- stylesheets and index are separated pgs
- `link` goes inside the `<head>`
```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
```
↳ favicon = free icon 
google fonts = free fonts

# HTML Boilerplate #
- ready-made template for WP
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta
			name="viewport"
			content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>freeCodeCamp</title>
		<link rel="stylsheet" href="./styles.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```
- `meta` → site's metadata - character encoding, how the WS should preview your page link etc.
- `title` - text shown in browser tab/window

- using boilerplate can start off building a WP & save time
## UTF-8 Character Encoding ##
- UTF-8 / UCS Transformation Format 8:
	- standardised character encoding widely used on the web
- byte - unit of data consisting of 8 bits / binary digits

## Viewport ##
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
↳ how to control the page's dimensions and scaling, esp. on mobile devices

1. `<meta>`
	- HTML element that provides **metadata** (data about data) about the page
	- Metadata isn't displayed directly on the page
2. `name="viewport"`
	- specifies that this `<meta>` tag is about the **viewport**
	- viewport is the **visible area of a WP** in a browser window or on a device screen

3. `content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"`
	- `width=device-width` → sets the viewport width to **match the device's screen width** 
		- w/o this, mobile browsers may **Shrink to page to fit**, making text tiny and layout messy
	- `initial-scale=1.0` → sets the **initial zoom lvl** of the page to 100%
		- 1.0 means no zoom
		- If you don't incl. this, some devices may **zoom in or out automatically**, causing your layout to appear too big or too small

# HTML Fundamentals #
## Div Elements
- Content Division Element = `<div></div>`
	- `<div>` 
		- can give height, width, background colour using CSS = *styling*
		- Groups elements together
- Semantic language → `<section></section>` might be better to group elements
## IDs and Classes ##
- `id` → attribute = unique identifier
```html
<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
```
- this can be references in CSS or JavaScript
```CSS
#title {
	color: red;
}
```
- '#' hashtag also tells the computer that we're wanting to use ID attribute
	- target ID - shouldn't be used more than once
	- no spaces in between; only letters, numbers, underscores and dashes

- `class` → attribute = not unique + can contain spaces
```html
<div class="box"></div>
```
- multiple class names = add space 
```html
<div class="box red-box"></div>
```
```CSS
.box {
	width: 200px;
	height: 200px;
	border: 2px solid black;
}
```
- '.' dot also tells the computer that we're wanting to use class attribute

∴ Class = applying a SET of styles to many elements
∴ ID = targeting a specific element
## HTML Entities ##
- HTML entities = character reference
	- e.g. instead of `<img/>`, to be shown on the WS, we need to use \&lt;img /\&gt;
- Named references - using ampersand + letters + semicolon
- Decimal Numeric references - using ampersand + hash symbol + decimal digits + semicolon
- Hexadecimal Numeric reference: using ampersand + hash symbol + letter x + ASCII hex digits + semicolon
## Script Element ##
- Script = embed executable code - pop-up message
```html
<body>
	<script>
		alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
	</script>
</body>
```
- alert display ↑ shows when WP first loads
	- user can click OK to dismiss the msg
- can be written in html, but should use in JavaScript file 
```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```
```JavaScript
alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp")
```
↳ Don't place all JS inside HTML doc = separation of concerns
	- SoC = design principle; separate programs into distinct sections + have each secs address a separate concern
## Meta Description ##
- `meta` description element affects SEO = Search Engine Optimisation
	- SEO → makes WP more visible, rank higher on SEs
	- providing a short description on `meta` element = ↑ SEO
- e.g. gardening site
```html
<meta
	name="description"
	content="Discover expert tips & techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaing a thriving garden."
/>
```
↳ not visible on WP; just on SE results page snippet
- strong description = higher traffic
## Open Graph Tags ##
- Open Graph Protocol - control how your WS content appears across various social media platforms
	- encourages clicks + ↑ engagement
	- placed in `head` section
```html
<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta 
	content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/img.png" property="og:image"
/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />
```
- use images that are at least 1200x630 pxs for best display on HR devices
	- minimum = 600x315 pxs
↳ most used are these 4: og:title, og:type, og:image, og:url
- some others: description, audio, video, locale
# Audio & Video Elements #
## HTML Audio & Video Elements ##
`<audio>` - mp3, wav, ogg
`<video>` - mp4, ogg, webm

```html
<audio 
	src="CrytalizeThatInnerChild.mp3" 
	controls
	loop
	muted
></audio>
```
`src` for source address
`controls` for audio controls; w/o this attribute, you can't see the audio file on the WP
`loop` to play on repeat
`muted` to start the audio in muted sate when WP is loaded
```html
<audio controls>
	<source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
	<source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
	<source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
</audio>
```
↳ to accomodate each browser with supported audio types
- browser plays the first type, but if it doesn't work, moves down the list
```html
<audio 
	src="CrytalizeThatInnerChild.mp3" 
	controls
	loop
	muted
	poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
	width="620"
></audio>
```
↳ video files, similar to audio BUT can add `poster` attribute
	- displays an img while the vid downloads
	- `width` attribute for better video fit
# Working w Images & SVGs #
## Common ways to Optimise Media Assets ##
1. Size
	- 640x480 resolution = width (comes first) & height (comes last)
	- If image has a certain resolution, serve it at that resolution
		- if you're serving a large img (1920x1080) but style it to be smaller = making users download unnecessary data
2. Format
	- png & jpg
	- BUT more optimised: WEBP or AVIF
3. Compression
	- reduces size for files or data
		- e.g. pngcrush → local img compression
		- OR can use online compression tools
	- JPG AREN'T *lossless* (og data can be perfectly reconstructed)
		- so JPG when compressed = degraded qual.
## Image Licenses ##
- images = intellectual property; protected by copyright regulations unless:

	1. Obtain written permission
	2. Purchase a license 
	3. Fair Use
		- tricky; e.g. parody of the img

- Permissive license → Creative Commons license, BSD license 
	- these are available for use in your WS BUT need to read the license first
		- e.g. WS needs to be open source OR not allowed to modify

- Released to public domain
	- ones w/o copyright + free; no restrictions
	- Creative Commons O license
		- Pixabay & Unsplash offers free-to-use imgs
## SVGs ##
- Raster Format - PNG & JPG
	- pixel based
	- can't upscale well
		- becomes pixelated + blurry
- Vector Format - SVG
	- scalable vector graphic
		- tracks data based on paths & equation to plot points, lines & curves
	- size can be scaled w/o qual. being impacted
	- stores data in XML = can be used directly as raw HTML `svg` element = programmatically change colour of img
	- can use for icons, custom bullet points, WP logos etc.
		- Font Awesome - uses SVG imgs for their icons
# iframe Element #
## Replaced Elements ##
- content determined by an external resource rather than CSS
	- common replaced elements: `<img>`, `<iframe>`, `<video>`
	- it's where element itself is REPLACED w the external object (image)
	- e.g.
```html
<img src="example-img-url" alt="Descriptive text goes here">
```
↳ CSS can modify the img itself BUT can put filter to it, reposition the img
```html
<ifram src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>
```
↳ `iframe` embeds external site - e.g. Maps or YT vids so the replaced element: the site
- site can't be modified
## Embed Videos using iframe ##
- `<iframe>` = inline frame = inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within an HTML page
	- e.g. Map, video etc.
```html
<h1>A freeCodeCamp YT Video embedded w the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
	src="video-url"
	width="width-value"
	height="height-value"
	title="YT video player"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
	allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```
`src` = specifies URL → need .../embed/.. within the URL 
`allowfullscreen` = users can view iframe in full screen mode
- IMPORTANT to add `title` 
- video can come from anywhere

For embedding direct HTML within the iframe element, `srcdoc` attribute required, not `src`:
```html
<h1>Heading1 Embedded w the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
	srcdoc="<h1>Thank you for watching!</h1>"
	height="500"
	width="400"
></iframe>
```
# Links #
## Target Attribute Types ##
- `target` attributes are commonly seen in anchor or link elements
	- tells the browser → where to open the URL
4 commonly used `target`:
1. `_self`
	- default value
	- opens link in the current tab or window
2. `_blank`
	- opens link in a new tab or, if configured to do so, new window
3. `_parent`
	- opens link in the parent of the current context
		- e.g. WS has `iframe`, `_parent` value in the iframe will open in current tab/window, NOT int he embedded frame
4. `_top`
	- opens link in the top-most browsing context
		- parent of the parent
	- similar to `_parent`, link will open in the full browser tab/window even nested in embedded frames
5. `_unfenced Top`
	- ==currently not really used==
	- for experimental FencedFrameAPI
## Absolute & Relative Paths ##
- Paths → string specify the file/directory location in a file system
	- for imgs, stylesheets, scripts, other WPs
### Absolute Path ###
- COMPLETE link to resource
	- starts from root directory
	- http:// OR https:// OR file://
```html
<a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
  View fCC Logo
</a>
```
↳ 
- protocol: https
- domain name: design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org
- filename: fcc_secondary_small.svg
```html
<p>
  Read more on the
  <a
    href="/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html"
    >About Page</a
    >
</p>
```
↳ for paths on local machine

`file:///Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html`
↳ absolute URL on address bar
### Relative Path ###
- DOESN'T incl. protocol + domain name
- shorter & more flexible for internal links within the same WS
	- e.g.
```html
<p>
  Read more on the
  <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
</p>
```
∴ Use Absolute Paths:
- when linking to resource hosted on an external WS
- when we need to link to a page/resource to work consistently regardless of the document location within the site

∴ Use Relative Paths:
- when linking to resources within the same WS
- to keep code cleaner + easier to maintain
- during local testing to ensure links work w/o an internet connection
## Slashes, single dot, Double dot ##
### Slash ###
- `/public/logo.png`
	- can be both \ or / - depends on OS
	- "path separator"
		- indicate breaks in text btw folder/file names
### Single Dot ###
- `./script.js`
	- access current directory
	- if current file needs to load another file within the same folder, relative path w a single dot is used
### Double Dot ###
- `../styles.css`
	- access parent directory
	- if current file needs to load another file in a DIFFERENT folder, relative path w double dots used 
## Link States ##
- `:link`
	- default
	- user hasn't interacted w the link yet
	- base style
- `:visited`
	- user visited the link → link turns purple after the user clicking on the link
	- CSS can change the purple visual
- `:hover`
	- user hovers cursor on the link
	- brings attention to a link
- `:focus`
	- when we focus on a link by 'Tab' key
		- often shows a blue border around the link
- `:active`
	- user "activates" (clicks) the link
		- usually turns red

These states needs a specific order on CSS:
	link, visited, hover, focus, active
