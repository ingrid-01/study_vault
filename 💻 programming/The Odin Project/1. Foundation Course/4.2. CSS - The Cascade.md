# Cascade of CSS #
- CSS responds only to what we tell it to do
- BUT each browser styles vary, hence, when finding unexpected beh. in CSS, it's due to:
	1. browser default style
	2. not understanding how a property works
	3. not understanding *cascade*

**CASCADE** = determines which rules are applied where
3 factors of CSS: specificity, inheritance and rule order

## Specificity ##
- CSS declaration ↑ specificity >>> CSS declaration ↓ specificity
- Inline style = highest specificity
- Out of selectors, most specific to least specific:
	1. ID selectors 
	2. Class selectors
	3. Type selectors

- specificity taken into account WHEN an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it
	- ID selector ALWAYS wins
	- Class selectors win over Type selectors
	- Type selectors win over less specific selectors
- When no declaration w selector of higher specificity = a greater # of selectors of the same type will take precedence over another rule w fewer selectors of the same type
e.g.
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list subsection">Red text</div>
</div>
```
```css
/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
```
↳ 
- Both rules = only class selectors
- Rule 2 = more specific BECAUSE it uses more selectors
∴ `color: red` declaration take precedence

e.g.
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list" id="subsection">Blue text</div>
</div>
```
```css
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
```
↳ 
- Rule 2 = more class selectors BUT ID selectors overrule
∴ Rule is most specific = `color: blue` takes precedence

e.g.
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list" id="subsection">Red text on yellow background</div>
</div>
```
```css
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main #subsection {
 color: red;
}
```
↳
- Rule 1 = ID selector
- Rule 2 = ID selector + class selector
- so NEITHER rule is more specific than the other
BUT cascade checks # of each selector type
- both rules = 1 x ID selector
- Rule 2 = class selector in addition = 2 rules
∴ rule 2 = higher specificity
∴ `color: red` takes precedence + `background-color: yellow` would still be applied

==special symbols in css, such as `*` (universal selector) or +, ~, > (combinators) DOESN'T add specificity==

```css
/* rule 1 */
.class.second-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

/* rule 2 */
.class .second-class {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```
↳
- both rules = same specificity
- Rule 1 = chaining selector (no space)
- Rule 2 = descendant combinator (empty space)
- both rules have 2 classes + combinator symbols = doesn't add specificity

```css
/* rule 1 */
.class.second-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

/* rule 2 */
.class > .second-class {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```
↳ 
- Rule 2 uses a child combinator (>) BUT
- same as above example, no change in specificity value

```css
/* rule 1 */
* {
  color: black;
}

/* rule 2 */
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
```
↳ `*` universal selector = no specificity
∴ Rule 2 = higher specificity
`color: orange` will take precedence
## Inheritance ##
- CSS properties when applied to an element = inherited by that element's descendants; even when a rule isn't written for it
- Typography-based properties (`color, font-size, font-family`) usually inherited
	- most other properties aren't
- Exceptions = directly targeted element
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```
```css
/* styles.css */

#parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}
```
↳ `color: blue` applied
BECAUSE even though `parent` has an ID selector = higher specificity
- `child` declaration DIRECTLY targets the element
## Rule Order ##
- WHICHEVER rule was LAST defined = winner winner chicken dinner
```css
/* styles.css */

.alert {
  color: red;
}

.warning {
  color: yellow;
}
```
↳ for element has both `alert` and `warning`, cascade runs through specificity (not applied here) and inheritance (again, can't be applied), last rule given was `.warning` so `color: yellow` will be applied

## The CSS Cascade - Wattenberger ##
### 1. Importance ###

**First Tier of Cascade** = Type of rule
	4 basic types of rules:
		1. transition
			1. *active transition* take the utmost importance
		2. `!important`
			1. when `!important` is added at the end of our declaration = jumps to this lvl of Cascade; reserved until last → override styles from third-party libraries
			2. Don't use this → causes problems; find a better way to write my code
		3. animation
			1. *active animation* than is next taken seriously
		4. normal
			1. where the bulk of rules live
### 2. Origin ###

**Second Tier of Cascade** = Where the rule was defined
	3 places: 
		1. website
			1. only lvl I have control over as a web dev.
		2. user
		3. browser
			1. each browser has its own set of styles
				- e.g. `<buttons>` have default style
- ==important==
	- `!important` rule is reversed here!!!
		- `!important` browser default WINS over `!important` WS
### 3. Specificity ###

**Third Tier of Cascade** = specificity of a rule
	5 lvls of selectors:
		1. inline
			- styles declared within a style; most specific!
		2. layer
```css
@layers one, two; // defining our layers

@layer one {
  body { color: red; }
}
@layer two {
  body { color: green; }
}
```
↳ `layer two` wins= defined after layer one
- unlayered styles will take precedence
- COMING SOON! 

	3.  id
		- using `#` syntax
		- try not to use id too much, as once I use an id, it'll overrides all other class
	4. class | attribute | pseudo-class
		- using `.` syntax
		- pseudo-class, such as `:hover` and `:first-of-type`
		- try to stay within this lvl for most, if not all, of css coding
	5. type | pseudo-element
		- `type` syntax (just the name of the type)
		- pseudo-element, such as `:before` and `:selection`
### 4. Position ###

**Fourth Tier of Cascade** = Order of rules defined
- Rules defined later wins
