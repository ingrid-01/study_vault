# IT Overview #
## Computers ##
* machine that can quickly complete a vast number of extremely simple tasks
#### Input ####
* how we physically interact w computers
	* commands are given through interactions (i.e. buttons)
* establish a connection - input device → computer's motherboard
	* input device detects & reports an event (i.e. a mouse click) → info is communicated with binary codes → sent to CPU (*Central Processing Unit*) for processing
#### Processing ####
* CPU controls all the diff. components btw hardware & software
	* the "BRAIN" of computer
* CPU holds responsibility of establishing communication btw hardware & software
	* the quick process of "taking in info" and "executing the associated instructions" = MEMORY*
#### Memory ####
* temporary OR permanent data storage
##### Primary Memory #####
* when a command to run a program → sent to CPU → CPU retrieves data from RAM (Random Access Memory) to access correct instructions
	* accessing data from RAM is *significantly* faster than accessing data from other memory systems
	* BUT only temporary storage; once we exit a program/turn the comp. off = data is lost
##### Second Memory #####
* Data saved onto our computer's hard drive = stored permanently and accessible anytime*
#### Output ####
* Once CPU process data and sends out instructions = output is produced
* Output devices:
	* Monitors
	* Speakers
	* Printers
* Output = final step in the process of comp. interaction
### Important Hardware ###
#### The CPU ####
Central Processing Unit→ electronic circuitry executing instructions based on binary input. Includes:-
* Control Unit (CU)
* Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU)
* Registers (immediate Access Store)
	* these 3 work together to process data
		* Data = series of binary = on and off = electrical pulses
		* theses pulses run through different wires, semiconductors & components
##### Control Unit #####
* CU = overseer of CPU
	* responsible for controlling and monitoring input & output
	* CU receives instructions from the software 
	* MAIN JOB:-
		* data is sent to the right component, at the right time & arrives w integrity
		* keeps all the hardware working on the same schedule → done w a clock (regular electrical signals are sent to all components to coordinate activities*
##### ALU #####
* ALU = all processing on computer takes place
	* i.e. scrolling down a text box, ALU calculates pixel changes on screen
	* brain of the entire computer
	* 2 primary areas:-
		* arithmetic operations, dealing w calculating data (e.g. `5 * 4 = 20`)
		* logic operations, deal w comparisons & conditionals  (e.g. `25 > 10`)
##### Registers #####
* Register a.k.a immediate access store → limited space, high-speed memory; CPU uses for quick processing
	* small pieces of memory, fixed in number & defined in the instruction set architecture - typically 8 16, 32 or 64
	* fixed in size based on size of the number it can hold
	* provides storage & access value crucial to immediate calculations that ALU processes
#### Memory ####
* Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Buses (high-speed wires)
* hard disk 
* other non-volatile memory
##### Random Access Memory #####
RAM → additional high-speed memory; data stored and accessed on short-term basis
* amount of RAM in computer = computer's general performance (direct correlation)
* primary volatile memory → loses data stored as power disconnects
##### Buses #####
bus = job-specific high-speed wire
	-  grouped together in bundles & transfer electrical signals in parallel (at once) OR in serial (one pulse at a time)
	- 3 functions:-
		- data bus
			- carry data back & forth btw processor & other components
			- bidirectional → transfer data to & from other locations
		- address bus
			- carry a specific address in memory → unidirectional
			- sends address, component knows where to find the data it needs
		- control bus
			- unidirectional
			- responsible for carrying control signals of the CU 
			- clock signals for synchronisation
##### Hard Disk #####
* hard disks OR hard drives → long-term/secondary storage
* non-volatile memory = retain info when computer is shut down*
#### Additional Hardware ####
##### The Mainboard #####
* a.k.a motherboard = printed circuit board, houses important hardware components via ports
* Hardwares (CPU, hard drive, USB devices) → connected through ports on mainboard
* allows components to communicate easily
##### Ports #####
* physical outlet to connect outside, (IO - Input/Output devices) to a computer
* a computer contains multiple ports
	* allows communication btw IO device (keyboards, mice, monitors) & computer
### Number Bases ###
- humans have 10 fingers = our usual number system/base is on 10
- common computer bases are binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16)
	- Binary (Base 2): leading 0b → i.e. 0b1100111101
	- Decimal (base 10): leading nothing
	- Hexadecimal (base 16): leading 0x
#### Binary ####
* Binary numbers
	* expressed in combination of 0s and 1s (i.e. 1001100 for number 38)
	* common ex:-
		* machine code
		* Boolean Expressions (true & false)
		* Hardware states (On & Off)
		* Networking & File storage
* Binary Data
	* computers only understand 2 states of being - off and on (0 & 1)
	* binary numbers representing alphabets - e.g. ASCII (older system), Unicode (current international stndrd characters)
	* comes in specific lengths - e.g. eight bits = *Byte*, 2 Bytes (16 bits) = *Word* 
#### Hexadecimal ####
* often called "hex"
* every 4 binary digits become a single hexadecimal digit
* often used for values like colours & memory addresses
* 0 to 9 → digits; 10 to 15 → A to F
* hex digits to 4 binary digits
	* 0xA9FC = 0b1010100111111100
### Value of a Digit ###
* need to convert non-decimal number to a decimal number
* Value of digit = determined by its placement in a number
	* digit's value x base value ^exponent value
		* exponent value begins at 0 for the rightmost digit
		* exponent value ↑ by 1 each time move to the left

> i.e. decimal number `123` (decimal value w a base of 10)

		1 · 10² + 2 ・10¹ + 3 ・10⁰
> 
> rightmost digit = `3`
> 	3 x by base value 10 to the power of 0 (10⁰) = 3
> next digit = `2`
> 	2 x base value 10 to the power of 1 (10¹) = 20
> final digit = `1`
> 	1 x base value 10 to the power of 2 (10²) = 100 
> 		∴ 100 + 20 + 3 = 123

> i.e. decimal number `101` (decimal value of binary number - base of 2)
		`1 ・ 2² + 0 ・ 2¹ + 1 ・2⁰`
> 
> rightmost digit = `1`
> 	1 x 2⁰ = 1
> next digit = `0`
> 	0 x 2¹ = 0
> final digit = 1
> 	1 x 2² = 4
> 		∴ `4 + 0 + 1 = 5`
> 		∴ binary value 101 = decimal value 5

PRACTICE
- convert binary value 11101 
		`1 ・2⁴ + 1 ・2³ + 1 ・2² + 0 ・ 2¹ + 1 ・ 2⁰`

		∴ 16 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 29
### Units of Measure in Computing ###
* EVERYTHING in computer is represented by numbers
* ALL OPERATIONS are some form of arithmetic
#### Data representation and Storage ####
* *bit* = smallest unit of data for computers; 0 or 1 / on or off
* ALL data represented in binary notation
	* number `228` = `11100100`
	* lowercase `j` = `01101010`
		* in ASCII encoding standard
		* THESE groupings of 8 bits → *very common* = called a ***byte*** 

| Value         | Name (Abb.)     | Example                                     |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `1000 Bytes`  | `Kilobyte (kB)` | `A typical email (~2kB)`                    |
| `1000² Bytes` | `Megabyte (MB)` | `A novel (~1.5MB) or 1 song (~5MB)`         |
| `1000³ Bytes` | `Gigabyte (GB)` | `A 1080p movie (5GB`                        |
| `1000⁴ Bytes` | `Terabyte (TB)` | `Entire major libraries`                    |
| `1000⁵ Bytes` | `Petabyte (PB)` | `All the data held by a major tech company` |
#### Measuring storage performance ####
* file sizes = storage performances
	* i.e. hard drive w speed of 1 megabyte/sec (1MBps) = example song ^ would take 5 secs to load before playing
* Modern drives → solid state drives 
	* portable devices (e.g. phones) → read files @ ~1500 MBps; write files @ ~500Bps
	* desktop devices → read & write > 5000 MBps
##### Special Types of Storage #####
* RAM (used for intermediate storage) → usually ~ 20,000 MBps
	* only cover sequential throughput
		* ***throughput*** - total amount of data transferred during a given amount of time
		* ***latency*** - amount of delay before transfer of data begins
	* newer devices have RAM latency ~10 nanosecs, fastest solid-state drives (SSDs) have latency time of a few microsecs (almost 1000x slower)
#### Measuring Internet Performance ####
- internet bandwidth & latency → same measurement as data speeds
	- consists of entire "pipe" that attempts to bring the data to a device, such as:-
		- speed of server providing data
		- miles of cables connecting it to an internet service provider (ISP)
	- speeds decided by the slowest device along the entire chain
	- even if consumer owns the fastest routers & computers, if the server is an ancient turtle connected w shoestring to the internet, entire connection will be slow
#### Measuring Computational Performance ####
* each CPU has a clock speed (how quickly it can do computations) → around 3.5GHz or 3.5 billion operations/sec
	* will likely stay around this number for the foreseeable future to physical limitation in the durability of silicon
* MORE important!!
	* ***number of cores*** in a CPU
		* 1 core = 1 computation at a time
			∴ more cores = more computations done simultaneously
	* GPU (graphical processing units)
		* similar to CPU *but* diff
			* more computational cores (up to 80)
			* slower clock speeds (around 2GHz)
#### Measuring Electricity Usage ####
* measured in watts
* more powerful device = more energy used
	* ==***cost of electricity can eclipse the cost of the device***== 
		* servers can be completely replaced because of improvement in power consumption
* All energy taken by device = dissipated as heat
	∴ more powerful device = needs more complex cooling solution to maintain performance
## Networking and the Internet ##
* way for computers all around the world to communicate w each other
	* sends vast amounts of data

[[3.ii. Learn What to Learn - Paths in Programming#3. Overview of the Internet]]
### Tutorial: Setting up a Wireless Network ###
* To set up a wireless network, you need:-
	1. Modem (and power cord)
	2. Wireless router (and power cord)
	3. Coaxial cable
	4. Ethernet cable
* Then contact an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
	* choose a provider & a plan
#### Getting Set-Up ####
##### Finding a Location #####
* choose a spot where we want wireless connection to manage from
	* typically a central location 
		↳ most consistent coverage throughout the house
* find the nearest coaxial (or coax) outlet
##### Setting up a Modem #####
* Modem → acts as a interface btw signal coming from coaxial outlet & your devices
* Modem *translates* signals being piped into your home into something your comp. can understand and vice versa
* Using coax cord, connect the modem to the outlet. Then power on the modem 
##### Setting up a Router #####
* Final Step to launch our network
* Router's primary function = take modem signals & transmit it throughout your home for wireless access
	* nowadays, most modems have a built-in router
1. Connect router to the modem via ethernet cable (ethernet cable pass internet signal from model to router)
2. Power on Router
3. Your personal network has successfully been deployed
4. Customising your configurations:
	* in a web browser, enter the router's IP address (an address that identifies a device)
	* loggig in using the credentials provided w the router; set both network name & pswd
### Network Basics ###
* Our devices use a network connection + goes through a series of porotocols to send & receive info. 
	* **Network** = 2 or more comps./devices linked to share info
* Comps. & devices can communicate due to a large set of standards (like road systems)
#### Types of Networks ####
* Most common networks types:
##### 1. LAN #####
* *Local Area Network* = smaller network connecting multiple devices in a limited area. E.g.:-
	* small office
	* home
	* other networks contained within a small area
##### 2. CAN ######
* *Campus Area Network* = connects multiple computers & devices over a slightly larger area. Connects multiple buildings located in a same vicinity. E.g.:-
	* university
##### 3. WAN #####
* *Wide Area Network* = connects multiple computers over a geographically large area. E.g.:- 
	* Large international orgs,
- Companies may use VPN (*Virtual Private Network*) for secure connection
	- *VPN* allows systems across lrg regions to connect & interact w one another on the same network
- TECHNIALLY the whole internet is WAN
#### OSI: Network Model ####
*Open Systems Interconnection* Model - developed in 1970s & 1980s
* breaks down networking into 7 layers:-
	1. Physical
	2. Data Link
	3. Network
	4. Transport
	5. Application
	6. Presentation
	7. Session
		- each layer usually interacts w the layer below it OR info to the layer above it
		- OSI categorise network processes → can communicate during troubleshooting & improving security
#### OSI Layer 1 and 2 ####
##### LAYER 1 - Physical #####
* Lowest layer of the model
	* unstructured data (i.e. bits) transmission
		* wire configuration
		* signals sent through those wires
		* radio frequencies computer uses
		* WiFi, Bluetooth, cable standards (CAT5 and CAT6)
		* Hardwares: modems, adapters, repeaters
* Raw data bits are received as 0s and 1s
* Fixing errors in this layer = physical damage OR interferences
##### LAYER 2 - Data Link #####
* Data sent from device to device when connected on the SAME local network
* Functionalities incl.:-
	* incoming or outgoing data bits into ==*data frames*== (data structure constructed w rows & columns; similar to a database or Excel spreadsheet)
	* physical addresses of devices called *Media Access Control* (MAC) address
		* ALL devices have unique 48-bit MAC address
			* 1st 24 bits → manufacturer
			* last 24 bit → unique to each device
	* routes data frames to the correct physical addresses
		* *switch* (your comp. or router) keeps track of local devices & their AC addresses
		* makes sure data frames get tot the correct physical location
	* ensures synchronicity of flow of data btw devices - prevents memory jams, slow receiving physical device
	* detects errors within data frames
		* involves a system of error control
#### OSI Layers 3 and 4 ####
##### Layer 3 - Network ####
* how ==*data packets*== (broken down large data chunks for more efficient & reliable transmission across networks) are routed btw wider networks (i.e. internet)
* data frames = travels to local MAC addresses
* data packets = routed from a source IP address to a destination IP address
	* like an envelope
		* every comp/device assigned an IP address → formatted into 4 numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255 (e.g. 192.168.0.1)
		* routers help these envelopes to find where they need to go
##### Layer 4 - Transport #####
- ==how== data is transferred
	- e.g. uploading a photo from phone to socials
		- handles how the img is split (segmentation) + rate at which the packets are sent + how errors are handed if data packets don't make it to the site server
- most common transport protocols = **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) and **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)
#### OSI Layers 5, 6, 7 ####
##### Layer 5 - Session #####
- When 2 comps/devices started exchange = **session**
	- Layer 5 → responsible for opening, closing, maintaining sessions
		- Opening & Closing: authentication and authorisation measures
			- e.g. w/o logging in OR having right permissions, not able to connect to parts of the WS. IF logged in, access permission for set amount of time/session length
		- Management: ensuring communications occur successfully; provides safeguards in case of connection fails or drops
##### Layer 6 - Presentation #####
- incls. ALL methods converting data into format usable by an application
	- handles functions - i.e. encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption, compression/decompression of files
##### Layer 7 - Application #####
- incls. WS, browsers, email, mobile apps → how they render internet data so we can interact
- we witness the application layer in action everyday
### TCP/IP Model & Implementation ###
- OSI Model isn't the only model that describes networking
- TCP/IP Model = 4-layered model 

| OSI Model          | TCP/IP Model         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Application Layer  | Application Layer    |
| Presentation Layer | 〃                    |
| Session Layer      | 〃                    |
| Transport Layer    | Transport Layer      |
| Network Layer      | Internet Layer       |
| Data Link Layer    | Network Access Layer |
| Physical Layer     | 〃                    |
#### 1. Application Layer ####
- opening & closing of session
- translating data
- interaction w content @ application lvl

	multiple protocols for web content, email, accessing files (incl HTTP, FTP, SMTP etc.)
#### 2. Transport Layer ####
- TCP & UDP = core protocols here
	- *TCP* → connection-oriented protocol - more rigorous acknowledgement btw one sender & one receiver must happen before any data can be sent - ==fixed channel==
		- incl. flow control & error recovery
		- when larger amonunts of data need to be sent & timing = less concern
	- *UDP* → lightweight protocol
		- doesn't need fixed channel btw sender & receiver
		- used when amount of data sent is piecemeal & needs to be transmitted quickly 
#### 3. Internet Layer ####
- Where IP addressing & routing occur
#### 4. Network Access Layer ####
- a.k.a Link Layer
	- sending or receiving of network data at the local network lvl
### Network Protocols: DNS, HTTP, Email ###
- What are network protocols? 
	- a set of standards for devices interacting on the internet! 
		- important to understand these protocols from angle of ==network security==
			- Threat actors often abuse the protocol rules to gain access to sensitive info. 

- 3 Protocols within *TCP/IP* implementation Application Layer:
	1. **DNS**
		- *Domain Name System* (DNS) protocol → converts domain names to IP addresses
			- it's like a phonebook of internet
				- e.g. we can't remember the exact IP address when we access WS so
					- we request a URL → PC sends a DNS request to a DNS server → server returns the correct IP to route data to & from the requested WS
	2. **HTTP**
		- *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol* (HTTP) → handles our web requests to servers
			- uses a set of verbs - e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `HEAD` - to retrieve & send data
			- when pg is loaded. = multiple web requests to retrieve content like img, txt, formatting code
	3. **Email - IMAP, POP, SMTP**
		- *Internet Message Access Protocol* (IMAP) and *Post Office Protocol* (POP) - allows users to access emails strored on a remote web server
			- IMAP - servers store your email & return copies to you → allows access the same email on multiple devices
			- POP3 (POP ver. 3), emails are generally downloaded from the server onto a single device
		- *Simple Mail Transfer Protocol* (SMTP) - to send email

- How do data packets get routed to these services from the transport layer? 
	- Specific numbers (*ports*) reserved for diff. services = lanes for network traffic

|      | Transport Protocol | Port Numbers  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| DNS  | TCP/UDP            | `53`          |
| HTTP | TCP                | `80` / `8080` |
| IMAP | TCP                | `143`         |
| POP3 | TCP                | `110`         |
| SMTP | TCP                | `25` / `587`  |
### Network Protocols: SSH, SMB, FTP ###
- Protocols used commonly by IT professionals
#### SSH ####
*Secure Shell* (SSH) - access a remote terminal or virtual machine (VM) over a secure connection
- use this to configure & program a system remotely & securely
	- e.g. accessing Github from command line uses SSH
#### FTP ####
*File Transfer Protocol* (FTP) - transfer files from one system to another
- Modern implementations of FTP incl. encryption
#### SMB ####
*Server Message Block* (SMB) protocol - allows multiple users to interact w a remote system like a file share / printing services
- multiple people can view & modify shared resources & files in a centralised server
### Troubleshooting Method ###
#### 1. Identify the Issue ####
- fully identify the problem 
	- compare current beh. & how it differs from the expected beh.
		- e.g. when a WS doesn't load, shows a blank screen. 
	- verify that an error actually occurred. 
		- can this issue be duplicated? Run a quick check
			- e.g. Do other WS also exhibit same beh.?
#### 2. Research the problem ####
- dig deeper into the issue → understand the issue completely as possible
	- brainstorm what may have changed within this system since last working correctly
		- recent software update? 
		- any major changes to the system's configuration?
	- collect as much info as possible on this beh. for future reference esp. when attempting to solve this issue for someone else. 
		- use these notes to ground future steps & make sure that any recommended solution is solving the correct issue
#### 3. Establish a theory of probable cause ####
- create hypotheses on what could be the cause
	- e.g. not able to connect to the requested WS? 
		- main server could be down. 
		- OR PC being used lost its connection to internet
	- important to begin w most OBVIOUS causes first
		- for a machine cannot connect to the internet - unplugged Ethernet cable or shut-off network router are likely candidates
		- make a list of these causes from most common to the most abnormal
			- great punch list for solving the issue!
#### 4. Test this theory to determine the cause ####
- testing each of the likely causes to find the one true root cause
	- begin w easiest potential causes → will cover most ground the quickest & give further insight into feasibility of other causes
		- still document all attempted solutions
#### 5. Establish a plan of action & identify possible issues ####
- e.g. lack of internet connectivity caused by an unplugged Ethernet cable → plan = plugging the cable back in
- for complex causes, more steps will be needed to be taken
	- i.e. account of compliance measures, corporate policies, impact on the business
	- utilise device manuals or an internet search
#### 6. Implement this plan of action ####
DO IT
#### 7. Verify full system functionality and implement preventative measures ####
- verify that 1) solution has actually fixed the issue, 2) solution did not introduce any other regressions to the system
- implement preventive measures
#### 8. Document findings, actions, and outcomes ####
- compile any and all notes created during this process. 
- incl. the OG bad beh., the expected beh., all suspected causes, all tests performed, finally the complete solution incl. the plan of action & how the solution was verified

## Operating Systems & Applications of Software ##
* software = operating system that directs computer to use its hardware to complete certain tasks and allows human interactions*

**Basics of Operating Systems (OS)** 
- OS = system software responsible for handling basic functionalities of a comp. 
	- some examples of popular OSs are:
		- Windows
		- Linux
		- Mac
		- Android
		- iOS
	- Every comp. contains at least 1 OS, starts the moment a comp. is turned on
		- OS controls both software + hardware
		- core of an OS → *kernel* = manages ALL interactions btw hardware & software

**Functions of OS**
- Process Management
	- Comp. programs (instructions) dictate how a program should work when they're run
	- When we run a program - the instance of that execution is represented by a process
		- OS handle the responsibility of a managing active processes 
- Memory Management
	- Temporary(Primary/Main memory) and Permanent data
	- OS responsible of Primary memory stored in RAM 
- File Management
	- Storing source code in a folder on out comp. = utilising out comp.'s file system
	- OS manages info. about ind. files + directories they belong in
	- OS responsible for maintaining file systems 
		- performs tasks - e.g. creating, deleting, renaming, copying files and/or directories
- IO (Input/Output) Management
	- Devices used for interactions - e.g. mouse, keyboards, speakers
	- mouse = input device → we use it to send data
	- monitor = output device → used to communicate data to us
		- OS manages IO by ensuring communication btw IO hardware & IO software
- Multitasking
- Networking
- Security
- Providing a user interface
### Filesystems ###
