# 1. History of Computer Science #
## The First Programmer ##
* Charles Babbage (1837) - The Analytical Engine
	↳ perform mathematical operation & conditional statements
* Ada Lovelace (1847) - first real algorithm (sequence of steps comp follows to solve a problem)
	↳ calculate any Bernoulli Number
	↳ predicted more complex maths can be sovled on comps. 

1947 - Bell Labs - *transistors* 
↳ device used to switch & amplify electronic signals (comp basic building block
	↳ before, glass tubes were used
	↳ *transistors* = sturdier, cheaper, smaller (size of palm; now, size of a few molecules)

* Gordon Moore - predicted
	* *transistors* = would get smaller
	* *amount of transistors in an integrated circuit* = double every 2 yrs
	* STILL HELD TRUE!
		* Moore's Law

* 20th c - people perform mathematical computations by hand = computers
	↳ then replaced by machines = computers, used punch cards
* 1971 - IBM developed type programs (IBM Selectric Typewriter)*

# 2. Survey of Computer Science - The Tale of Kenny
## What is Computer Science? ##
* CS is about seeing patterns & to reveal opportunities for optimisation and improvement
## Algorithms ##
* ***sequential***
	* performed step-by-step
* ***conditional***
	* performs step based on condition
* ***generalisable***
	* applicable to other similar situations

* Nearly every tech uses some form of algorithm to sort, store and access data 
## Functions ##
↳ specific set of repeatable instructions (input → output)

>∴ ***algorithm*** = conceptual
>∴ ***function*** = puts algorithm into practice

## Control Flow and Logic ##
* developing a system = ==control flow==
	↳ a set sequence followed + based on some conditionals, diff. results are given
	* "if/then statements"
## Iteration ##
↳ when needing to repeat same operation on every item in a list
## Optimisation ##
* *linear search* → 처음부터 끝까지 찾는 방법; not ideal, takes long time
* *binary search* → if/then 상황, 빨리 & 효율성 ↑ 
## Abstraction ##

# 3. Overview of the Internet #
* 1969, US department of defense funded: ==ARPANET==
	↳ Advanced Research Projects Agency Network - connected supercomputing centers run by gov. agencies & unis
* 1970s - *transmission control protocol* and *internet protocol* (TCP/IP) = data transfer standards
## World Wide Web ##
*internet* = network of connected computing devices
* 1989, TIm Berners-Lee → *www*
	↳ collection of interlinked WSs & web resources
* 1990s - user-friendly interface; multimedia content consumed & other user interactions
## Browsers and Servers ##
* *client-server model* 
	- client = user's device/program requesting data; i.e. browser or an app
	- server = device/program in that network; waits for request & sends back data
- Browser → Client Request → Web Server
	- Web Server → Server response → Browser
* Browsers & Servers communicate through protocol
	* HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol (standard internet protocol)
	* allows data transfer
		* Common HTTP Requests: -

| ***Methods*** | ***Meaning***                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET           | retrieve info from given server                             |
| POST          | send data to the server (e.g. customer info OR file upload) |
| PUT           | replace current data w uploaded content                     |
| DELETE        | remove current data                                         |
* 404 error - requested content was not found
### 404 Status Code ###
* HTTP Status codes:
	* whether.or not HTTP request was successfully completed or if there's an error

| ***Code***                   | ***Explanation***                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200<br>OK                    | The request has succeded                                        |
| 301<br>Moved Permanently     | The resources has been moved and the client is being redirected |
| 404 <br>Not Found            | The requested resource was not found                            |
| 500<br>Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected error                      |
## How do browsers work? ##
1. User types in URL + enter → server processes request + send HTML file back → HTML file hold content + links & displays
2. browser search for elements in HTML file + make additional HTTP requests, which incl.:
	* 1 or more CSS (*cascading style sheets*) - style & layout of WP
	* request-response cycle → sends WS assets (images + vids)
		* if files are lrg, there can be noticeable delay before rendered by the browser
	* 1 or more JS files
		* interactive - beh. of the WP
		* WP that doesn't use JS = *static webpage*
			* text, images and links; don't change based on user beh. 
## Web 2.0 ##
* Web 2.0 applications:
	* offers content that responds to user input w/o forcing the page to reload; can avoid reloading interruptions 
	* emphasises user-generated content + social sharing
* Tech advances:
	* *jQuery* - first JS framework → fetch data while WP is running
	* *web frameworks* → connected databases, e.g. Spring, Django, Ruby-on-Rails
		* enabled user-generated content to create, store, display
## Current Internet Trends ##
* Responsive Web Design
	* CSS language - e.g. media queries & relative units
	* presentation of WS to adjust based on the size of the window in which they are displayed
* Mobile Applications and Devices
	* mob apps are not part of www.
		* web = built out of links
		* mob apps = designed to keep the user's attention*
# 4. Languages for Web Development #
## Web Development ##
* Learning new langs as a web developer: 
	* 4 main langs needed: - 
		1. **HTML** - structures WS content
		2. **CSS** - applies styling 
		3. **JavaScript** - adds interactivity
		4. **SQL** - allows web application to store & retrieve data
## HTML ##
* first step in building WS = *HTML* 
	↳ **HTML** : skeleton of all web pages; provides structure to content - incl. text, imgs, buttons, vids etc.
	* HTML = hypertext markup language*
### HTML Markup ###
* *ML* = markup language in HTML
	* a way of annotating text, distinguished from OG text 
	* separates content by HTML tags - denoted by angle brackets
### HTML Elements ###
![[Pasted image 20250619114847.png]]
`<p>` and `</p>` - paragraph element (opening tag and closing tag)

전체가 **HTML element** 
<> = **opening tag** 
</ > = **closing tag**
괄호 사이 = **content**
### Common Tags ###
`<h1>` is a heading `</h1>`

`<p>` is a paragraph `</p>` 

`<a>` anchor tag → specify the text that "anchor" for a link `</a>`

`<button>` is a button `</button>` 
### Hypertext & the WWW ###
*HT* = hypertext
	↳ text linked to other texts
* *hyper* = txt expands beyond the traditional constraints
* constraint text = reading a book from start to finish
* hypertext = browsing; clicking on linked pages = choose your own adventure!
	* embedded vids, animations, interactivity 
### Adding Hyperlinks ###
*attribute* = additional info about HTML element
	↳ `name="value"` 
		e.g. `width="500"`

*links* = `href` attribute (hyperlink reference)
	↳ specify URL/address
* `href` on an anchor tag (`<a>`) → specify BOTH text & URL
		e.g. `<a href="www.codecademy.com">Learn to code!</a>`
* when a link to another page on the same WS needs to be referenced, *relative path* URL can be used 
	* e.g. instead of `www.jetsetter.com/resume.html`, just `/resume.html` can be used
## CSS ##
* second step in building a WS → *style* 
	* incl. colours, fonts, positioning, layout etc.

==Why do we need separate langs?==
* **separation of concerns** → styling rules are separate from content itself
	* save time in the long run & easier to handle when the WS becomes more complex
### Applying CSS ###
*selectors* = specify HTML elements where style should be applied + *visual rules* to be displayed

`rel` = relationship btw current doc & linked resource
↳ can also indicate: 
1. resource is an icon
2. resource needs to be preloaded before the main doc
## Javascript ##
* some features built w JS:- 
	* Popup ads
	* animated graphics (2D or 3D)
	* interactive audio & vids
	* maps & other features access user's geographic location
* triggered by user interaction, such as:-
	* clicking on a button
	* pressing enter on their keyboard
	* vid. file finishing loading
	* re-sizing their window
	* hovering over txt on WP

`drawText` = shows what content should be displayed

functions are **reusable** = it can render any input txt w/o needing to rewrite the logic of the function
### JS Functions ###
1. Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once → then can be reused over & over
2. Events allow JS to respond to user beh.
∴ when an **event** is fired, a **function** is executed

`<script>` = alerts the browser that the page contains JS & separates JS code from HTML

`changeColor()` 

`document` = access page's bg colour, sets it equal to the new color

HTML attributes can SET events.
* ***name of the attribute*** = event
* ***value of the attribute*** = JS function we want to execute
## SQL ##
When the WS is built, all info needs to be stored somewhere.
An application to store, retrieve, modify data (i.e. usernames, shipping addresses, payment info)

*SQL* = structured query language
↳ stores info in tables

* to get the info → write a *query* (a program that retrieve data from table)
		e.g. a query:- 
			`SELECT * FROM page_views;` 
			==* is a shorthand for "all"== 
# 5. Introduction to Data Science #
*Data Science* → make data into meaningful info that helps us to make decisions
* probability
* statistics
* analytics
* computer science
![[Pasted image 20250619154308.png]]
## Statistics ##
* **descriptive statistics** - describe dataset using mathematically calculated values 
	↳ describe data in objective terms
	* e.g. mean, standard dev
	* distribution - *normal distribution* → mean = middle of the distribution, stnd dev = width of the distribution
* **inferential statistics** - inferences for the overall population based on data
## Probability ##
* "what could potentially happen"
* Prob used to build models (data we haven't collected OR data hasn't been created)
* in data science, prob is used to *stimulate scenarios* 
## Domain Expertise ##
* particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates & brings w them in order to understand their data
