# Which Programming Language Should You Choose? #
## What is a Programming Language ##
* computers = inputs & outputs
* programmers use programming langs so both comps and humans understand each other
* comps native tongue = Binary
	* closer to binary, faster comps can comprehend
	* ==Low-lvl==
		* Easy for comps
		* super duper fast
		* BUT difficult for humans to understand
			* operating systems & desktop programs
			* top tier video games
			* usually taught in CS degrees
			* more flexibility in what you can do BUT code may not run on other machines
	* ==High-lvl==
		* Easy for humans
		* Easy to maintain
		* BUT slower for comps (but still pretty fast)
			* websites & web apps
			* startups
			* usually taught in bootcamps
			* same code runs on many machines BUT more limited in what you can do

### What are your commands? ###
* **for fun**
	* HTML, CSS JavaScript, Python (in this order)
* **for curiosity**
	* What are you using for? 
	* What are your projects?

==Program = Patterns==
* once you learn one, easy to pick-up another

==Programming is about learning ==
* we're professional learners a.k.a Googlers 
* we're constantly asked why things are broke and how we solve it

==Programming is about learning from mistakes==
* DRY - don't repeat yourself
* ~~WHAT is a good code?*~~
* WHY is it a good code? ✅

==Programming is about solving problems==
* picking up programming w/o an issue, is like going shopping w/o a shopping list

## Tools ##
### Analyse Data ###
* SQL, Python and R
### Automation ###
* Ruby, JavaScript, Python
### Understanding Tech ###
* many companies stick with 'OLD' programs
* customers, investors, employers DON'T care which program it was built on
	↳ but does it WORK?
* For games:
	1. learn a programming lang
	2. use a library, framework or engine to save time
	* Simple 2D games: python or JavaScript
	* Complex 3D games: C# or C++
* For Mobile Games:
	* there is no one best program, just choose one and code
* Look through senior jobs on the jobmarket to map out future plans 
* Start with smaller goals then move to bigger ones
# What is Programming? #
> Collabs btw humans & computers

## Programming is Everywhere and is for Everyone ##
* code enables everyday actions in out lives
	* delivery services
	* taxi 
	* influence presidential elections 
	* personal trainer

Programming = set of instructions, like recipes

## Programming as Communication or Coding ##
* _Programming_ → mental process of THINKING up insturctions to give to a machine (==GENERAL==)
* _Coding_ → process of transforming those ideas into a written language that computer can understand (==WRITTEN LANG==)
* ***Programming evolution*** - began with punch cards w rows of numbers → drag-and-drop interfaces
* Programming languages are constantly being made to improve accessibility 
	* e.g. Arabic programming lang (==한국어 프로그램도 존재하는가?==)
	* improving access for blind and visually impaired*

## Programming as Collaboration ##
> *The problem w programming is not that the computer isn't logical - the computer is terribly logical, relentlessly literal-minded*
> - Ellen Ullman, *Life in Code*

* Comps interpret instructions in a very literal manner - need specificity
* think as a collaboration

| Human                                  | Computer                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Thinks creatively                      | No creativity (follows given instructions) |
| Communicates through interference      | Limited hard-wired knowledge               |
| Detects patters to make sense of world | Calculates info quickly                    |
| inconsistent                           | Consistent                                 |
| Can get bored                          | Does not lose focus                        |
The best comp programs = enable us to make things that couldn't on our own; leverage our creative capacity

# How Long Does it Take to Learn to Code
* 5 - 15 hrs / wk recommended
* work on Real-World Problems!!!
* good developers = good learners
