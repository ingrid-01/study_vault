## Intro to Careers in Web Development ##
### Web Development Roles ###
#### Front End ####
* FE runs on user's browser + visual application (sees & clicks) 
* sends requests to BE when data etc. is needed

- *web page (WP) display & user interface + data*
- *enable + respond user input and actions*
- *BE comm*
- *security enforcement*
#### Back End ####
* non-visual; logic & data storage
* hidden application BUT responds requests from FE

* *WP generation*
* *FE respondent (retrieve, validate, save data)*
* *FE comm*
* *security enforcement*

#### Full-Stack ####
* knowledgeable + flexible enough to work both FE & BE
### Languages & Frameworks  ###
#### FE Tools ####
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build WPs
	* HTML = defines content & structure
	* CSS = styles the WPs
	* JavaScript = makes WPs interactive & responsive 

> *Almost ALL web devs have knowledge of these 3*

* FE frameworkes - i.e. React → provide reliable code for common tasks & enable devs to break application's user interface into reusable building blocks

#### BE Tools ####
* BE can write BE services in whatever languages they want + deploy them to a dedicated comp (a server)
* BE devs uses frameworks to provide code for common tasks (saves time & effort)
* Most pop langs + framework comb:
	* Python & Django
	* JavaScript & ExpressJS
	* PHP & Laravel
	* RUby & Ruby on Rails
	* Java & Spring
### Pathway to career in web development ###
1. Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript ***FUNDAMENTAL***
	* Learn HTML first (WP building), then CSS (styling), then JavaScript (responsive)
	* IF designs my things → focus on FE
	* IF data & computation is my thing → focus on BE
	* IF both interests me → full-stack
2. After learning languages, learn the most popular frameworks, such as React
