## 🎯 Today's Goal
* Finish chapter 8 - 타이머 사용하기: 로또 추첨기
	* 전에 배운 타이머를 집중적으로 사용해 보고 비동기 개념 다시 집어보기

## 🧠 What I Learned (Input)

• **Fisher-Yates Shuffle for Randomisation**: To effectively shuffle numbers (like the 45 lottery balls), the **Fisher-Yates algorithm** is used to move values from a "candidate" array to a "shuffle" array by picking a random index one at a time. This ensures that once a ball is "picked", it is removed from the remaining pool, preventing duplicates.

• **Managing Asynchronous Delays with** **async/await**: While `setTimeout()` is used to display balls one by one to build tension, traditional callbacks can lead to complex code. By **wrapping** **setTimeout** **in a Promise**, you can use `async/await` to make asynchronous code appear to execute sequentially, ensuring each ball is drawn only after a specific pause.

• **Block Scope vs Function Scope (****let** **vs** **var****)**: When using timers inside a loop, using **let** **is crucial** because it provides block scope. If `var` is used, the asynchronous callback may reference the variable only after the loop has already completed, leading to "undefined" errors or incorrect values because `var` is function-scoped and does not "lock in" the value for each iteration of the loop.

JavaScript Code Example: Promise-based Timer

The following code demonstrates how to refactor a standard timer into a **Promise-based function**, allowing you to use `await` for cleaner sequential execution as shown in the sources.

```
// A helper function that returns a Promise to handle delays
const setTimeoutPromise = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, ms);
});

async function drawLottoBalls(winBalls) {
  for (let i = 0; i < winBalls.length; i++) {
    // Execution pauses here for 1 second before moving to the next line
    await setTimeoutPromise(1000); 
    console.log(`Ball ${i + 1}: ${winBalls[i]}`);
    // Code to create and display the ball element would go here [6]
  }
}
```

Think of the **Fisher-Yates shuffle** like picking a name out of a hat: once you pull a name out and set it aside in a new pile, there is no chance of picking that same name again from the ha

## 💻 Code I Wrote (Output)
```javascript
// Paste a small snippet you practiced today here
function test() {
  console.log("Learning JS!");
}
```

## 🚧 Roadblocks & Bugs

- **The Problem:** (What was confusing in the lecture?)
    
- **The Fix:** (How did NotebookLM or the textbook explain it?)

### 🚀 How to use this with NotebookLM
This is where you save hours of work:

1.  **Feed the Source:** Upload your Korean YouTube transcript or textbook photos to NotebookLM.
2.  **Ask for a "Log Summary":** > *"Based on this lecture, give me a 3-bullet point summary of the most important concepts and one simple code example in JavaScript for my Obsidian log."*
3.  **Paste into Obsidian:** Copy that output directly into the **"What I Learned"** and **"Code I Wrote"** sections of your log.

### 💡 Why this works for Jira (Jan 24th)
When you restart Jira, your **Daily Log** becomes your "Work Evidence." 
* You'll open your Jira ticket (e.g., **SV-5: Study Loops**).
* You'll do your study and fill out this log.
* Your **Obsidian Git** will push this log to GitHub with a commit message like: `SV-5: Completed day 1 of Loop studies`.

### Next Step for you:
I recommend creating your first log entry for **today**! Even if it’s just one sentence about setting up this system.

**Would you like me to help you refine your `Coding-Archive` folder names so they match the topics in your Korean textbook?** (If you list a few chapters, I can help you organize the folders).

### 🚀 Restart Prompt: Jira-GitHub-Obsidian Sync

**"I am restarting my coding study setup. Please help me with the following 3 steps:**

1. **Jira Software:** Walk me through creating a **'Software Development' (Kanban)** project using a **'Company-managed'** setting.
    
2. **GitHub Integration:** Help me connect my existing `study_vault` repository to this new Jira project.
    
3. **Obsidian Sync:** We already have the **Obsidian Git** plugin and `.gitignore` working in my `coding_study` folder. I need to update my **'Commit Message Template'** in Obsidian Git to include my new Jira issue keys (e.g., `SV-1: {{date}}`) so my notes appear on my Jira tickets.
    

**Context:** My vault is already synced to GitHub, and I have a `coding_study` folder. We just need to link the new Jira project to this existing flow."
