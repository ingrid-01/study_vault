## 🧠 What I Learned (Input)
> *Summary of concepts from Textbook/YouTube via NotebookLM*
* **Topic 1:** [Name] - [Quick explanation]
* **Topic 2:** [Name] - [Quick explanation]

## 💻 Code I Wrote (Output)
```javascript
// Paste a small snippet you practiced today here
function test() {
  console.log("Learning JS!");
}

## 🚧 Roadblocks & Bugs

### 🚀 How to use this with NotebookLM
This is where you save hours of work:

1.  **Feed the Source:** Upload your Korean YouTube transcript or textbook photos to NotebookLM.
2.  **Ask for a "Log Summary":** > *"Based on this lecture, give me a 3-bullet point summary of the most important concepts and one simple code example in JavaScript for my Obsidian log."*
3.  **Paste into Obsidian:** Copy that output directly into the **"What I Learned"** and **"Code I Wrote"** sections of your log.

### 💡 Why this works for Jira (Jan 24th)
When you restart Jira, your **Daily Log** becomes your "Work Evidence." 
* You'll open your Jira ticket (e.g., **SV-5: Study Loops**).
* You'll do your study and fill out this log.
* Your **Obsidian Git** will push this log to GitHub with a commit message like: `SV-5: Completed day 1 of Loop studies`.

### Next Step for you:
I recommend creating your first log entry for **today**! Even if it’s just one sentence about setting up this system.

**Would you like me to help you refine your `Coding-Archive` folder names so they match the topics in your Korean textbook?** (If you list a few chapters, I can help you organize the folders).

### 🚀 Restart Prompt: Jira-GitHub-Obsidian Sync

**"I am restarting my coding study setup. Please help me with the following 3 steps:**

1. **Jira Software:** Walk me through creating a **'Software Development' (Kanban)** project using a **'Company-managed'** setting.
    
2. **GitHub Integration:** Help me connect my existing `study_vault` repository to this new Jira project.
    
3. **Obsidian Sync:** We already have the **Obsidian Git** plugin and `.gitignore` working in my `coding_study` folder. I need to update my **'Commit Message Template'** in Obsidian Git to include my new Jira issue keys (e.g., `SV-1: {{date}}`) so my notes appear on my Jira tickets.
    

**Context:** My vault is already synced to GitHub, and I have a `coding_study` folder. We just need to link the new Jira project to this existing flow."
