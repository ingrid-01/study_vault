## 🧠 What I Learned (Input)

• **Fisher-Yates Shuffle for Randomisation**: To effectively shuffle numbers (like the 45 lottery balls), the **Fisher-Yates algorithm** is used to move values from a "candidate" array to a "shuffle" array by picking a random index one at a time. This ensures that once a ball is "picked", it is removed from the remaining pool, preventing duplicates.

• **Managing Asynchronous Delays with** **async/await**: While `setTimeout()` is used to display balls one by one to build tension, traditional callbacks can lead to complex code. By **wrapping** **setTimeout** **in a Promise**, you can use `async/await` to make asynchronous code appear to execute sequentially, ensuring each ball is drawn only after a specific pause.

• **Block Scope vs Function Scope (****let** **vs** **var****)**: When using timers inside a loop, using **let** **is crucial** because it provides block scope. If `var` is used, the asynchronous callback may reference the variable only after the loop has already completed, leading to "undefined" errors or incorrect values because `var` is function-scoped and does not "lock in" the value for each iteration of the loop.

JavaScript Code Example: Promise-based Timer

The following code demonstrates how to refactor a standard timer into a **Promise-based function**, allowing you to use `await` for cleaner sequential execution as shown in the sources.

```
// A helper function that returns a Promise to handle delays
const setTimeoutPromise = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, ms);
});

async function drawLottoBalls(winBalls) {
  for (let i = 0; i < winBalls.length; i++) {
    // Execution pauses here for 1 second before moving to the next line
    await setTimeoutPromise(1000); 
    console.log(`Ball ${i + 1}: ${winBalls[i]}`);
    // Code to create and display the ball element would go here [6]
  }
}
```

Think of the **Fisher-Yates shuffle** like picking a name out of a hat: once you pull a name out and set it aside in a new pile, there is no chance of picking that same name again from the ha
