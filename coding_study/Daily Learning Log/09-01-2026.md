### 🚀 How to use this with NotebookLM
This is where you save hours of work:

1.  **Feed the Source:** Upload your Korean YouTube transcript or textbook photos to NotebookLM.
2.  **Ask for a "Log Summary":** > *"Based on this lecture, give me a 3-bullet point summary of the most important concepts and one simple code example in JavaScript for my Obsidian log."*
3.  **Paste into Obsidian:** Copy that output directly into the **"What I Learned"** and **"Code I Wrote"** sections of your log.

### 💡 Why this works for Jira (Jan 24th)
When you restart Jira, your **Daily Log** becomes your "Work Evidence." 
* You'll open your Jira ticket (e.g., **SV-5: Study Loops**).
* You'll do your study and fill out this log.
* Your **Obsidian Git** will push this log to GitHub with a commit message like: `SV-5: Completed day 1 of Loop studies`.

### Next Step for you:
I recommend creating your first log entry for **today**! Even if it’s just one sentence about setting up this system.

**Would you like me to help you refine your `Coding-Archive` folder names so they match the topics in your Korean textbook?** (If you list a few chapters, I can help you organize the folders).
